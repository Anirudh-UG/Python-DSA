This project is a complete tutorial to Data Structures & Algorithms

All problems in this repo were solved using the following steps

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify any inefficiencies.
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
7. Don't stop until you've implemented a correct solution that runs efficiently.

This repo follows the free code camp tutorial for Python DSA
